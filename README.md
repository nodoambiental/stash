## Wait, Time Travel?

Yes. The properties of this immutable store let you do _time travel_, which means you can go back in time and see, access, and rollback the state of the store at any point in time. This is a very powerful feature that can be used to implement _undo_ and _redo_ functionality.

## But I thought you said 4D?

Yes. This store allows you to branch off at any point in time, preserving the state of the branch you were in, letting you to continue working on new stuff, rollback/undo back to the branching point, and forward in a different branch, keeping the ability to displace to _any_ point in time/space in the structure of the store records. Pretty much like Git or othr VCS do.

## So, this is like a Git for Svelte state, or what?

You could say so. Of course, the goals and constraints this project have are completely different than the ones pertaining to version control, so don't expect it to be _exactly_ like Git and the likes.
